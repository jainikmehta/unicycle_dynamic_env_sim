# All debugging strategies used so far:

- Used lower and higher order CBFs.
- Used slack variables but ensuring value of h>=0.
- Fixed the path generated by the RRT planner, updating the path only when the h value drops below certain H_RECOVERY_THRESHOLD.
- Generated intermediate goal points to provide robot waypoints providing more flexibility in planning to avoid getting stuck.
- Changed constants to change penalty, horizon lenght, speed of the obstacles and the robot.

- Test same problem on both higher order and lower order CBFs
- When using different formulation of CBF like in v10. Need to test robustness.
- Sub task for starling drone and simulation.
- Computational Optimization course to be taken
- inputs to the h function should be same in all cases.
